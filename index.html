<h2>ACADEMIC PROJECT:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>TITLE: Heat Transfer Analysis of Engine Cylinder Fins of Varying Geometry and Material</li>
</ul>
<p>In this the Heat transfer rate of an air-cooled  engine with different  geometries  such as rectangular ,triangle and parabolic fins were created with varying  the lengths of 15mm,20mm,25mm and thickness of 2.5mm,3mm,3.5mm by using CATIAV5R10 modelling software. The analysis of these different shaped fins in steady state thermal was done by using ANSYS WORK BENCH 14.5. Presently fins were made by Aluminum Alloy A204, which has thermal conductivity of 110-150W/m-k. In this study cylinder fins were analyzed by taking different alloys such as Aluminum alloy 6061, Magnesium alloy AZ31 and Beryllium which has high thermal conductivity than aluminum alloy A204.The analysis has done in thermal steady state condition by taking the base temperature at inner wall of cylinder as 4230C, the ambient temperature as 250C and the Heat transfer coefficient h=200W/m2-K.Finally the optimal fin material is suggested for greater heat transfer rate.</p>
